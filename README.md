# Measuring Complexity in Cryptoeconomic Systems
Complexity is often cited as one of the distinguishing qualities of public blockchain networks. However, there have been few, if any, serious efforts aimed at quantifying levels of complexity within these systems. Most existing research has focused on the complexity found in cryptocurrency markets, rather than the systems themselves. 

This project applies information-theoretic measures to explore the complexity of the Bitcoin and Ethereum networks. The goal is to start _quantifying_ this complexity with a holistic focus on their key inputs, outputs, and internal structure, rather than limiting our view to the price dynamics of their tokens.

## Research Question
To what extent can emergence-based information-theoretic complexity measures quantify and clarify the operational dynamics of public blockchain networks?
